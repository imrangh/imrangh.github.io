    <p>
      Muruwai Beach is a good beach for surfing and bodyboarding. However, there
      are very strong rip currents and it is best to find out about the dangers
      of rip currents before you visit Muruwai beach. Muruwai is on the west
      coast of Auckland above the Waitakere Ranges ans is home to a large colony
      of gannets.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over a thousand gannets return from Australia every year between August
      and March
    </p>

    <p>
      There is car park near the beach, which leads to range of viewing
      platforms that allow visitors to close up views of the colony and the
      rough coastline
